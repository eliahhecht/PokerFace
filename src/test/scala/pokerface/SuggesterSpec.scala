  it should "rank hands correctly" in forAll(hands) {(handString: String, expectedKeeps: String) =>
    val hand = Hand.parse(handString)
    assume(hand.isDefined)
    val suggestion = new Suggester().suggestKeeps(hand.get)

    val keeps = suggestion.keeps
    val ev = suggestion.expectedValue
    println(s"From $hand, keep $keeps worth $ev")

    keeps should contain theSameElementsAs CardSetParser.parse(expectedKeeps)
  }
}
